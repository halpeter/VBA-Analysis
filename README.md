# VBA Analysis

## Background

In this project, I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. This analysis uses Excel's Visual Basic for Applications to hard code the functions and alter the data to make it more user friendly.

## Stock Market Analysis

* I created a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* I also added conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* Additionally, I returned the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

* This code is formatted to allow it to run on every worksheet within the Excel file.
